# 32-bit Interconnected RISC-V MCU CH32V307
EN | [中文](README_zh.md)



### Overview
The CH32V305 and CH32V307 are interconnected microcontrollers, based on 32-bit RISC-V core, with hardware stack area and fast interrupt entry. Compared with standard RISC-V, the interrupt response speed is greatly improved. With single-precision float point instruction sets added and stack area extended, the CH32V305/7 has higher performance, the number of U(S)ART is extended to 8, and the number of motor timer is extended to 4. The CH32V305/7 provides USB2.0 high-speed interface (480Mbps) and has built-in PHY transceiver. Ethernet MAC is upgraded to GbE and integrates 10M PHY module.
